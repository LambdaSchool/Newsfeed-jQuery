        <h2>Leaf Natural Products</h2>
        <p class="date">Oct, 2015</p>
        <div class="articleP">
          <p>Leaf Natural Products was created out of necessity Back in 2014, Matthias was hiking a lot and doing other strenuous activities.
          His go-to pain relief balm was Tiger Balm, because he had used it since he was young. Out of curiosity he looked at the ingredients
          and realized that his favorite balm was not at all what he thought it was.<br/><br/>Tiger Balm uses a petrochemical (petroleum) for
          its base and their Camphor is synthetic. Synthetic Camphor is usually derived from Kerosene. Matthias tried several other
          pain-relieving balms, but all of them were lacking. Eventually he decided that the best way to know what he was putting on
          his body was to make it himself. <br/><br/>Achy Breaky Balm was born 6 months later. For a while, the balm was just something Matthias
          made for himself, friends and family, mixing it up in his kitchen as needed. But over time, people began to ask for more,
          they gave it to their friends, and suddenly it seemed like everyone wanted it. <br/><br/>Matthias needed to make a real company, and
          he asked his good friend Shahrul to help out. <br/><br/>“What’s our mission?” asked Shahrul. <br/><br/>“To make the best products in world,”
          said Matthias. <br/><br/>“Okay, I’m in.” <br/><br/>We focus on the quality and origin of our ingredients, more than anything All of our ingredients
          are completely natural and if possible, organic. Most of our ingredients are 100% certified organic. Sometimes it isn’t possible
          to use an organic product, in which case we find the best possible all-natural alternative. For example, our beard oil contains
          amber oil, which is extracted from fossilized sap that is millions of years old - long before organic certifications were
          invented! The amber helps give our beard oil its distinctive color and scent. <br/><br/>You will only find the best ingredients in
          our products. We will never use any GMOs or petrochemicals. Also, if we find that any of our ingredients are responsible
          for human suffering, the destruction of the environment, or are just plain unhealthy...we will find a replacement of top
          quality. <br/><br/>We package in glass bottles and jars, and metal tins. We avoid plastic packaging whenever possible, because chemicals
          can migrate from the plastic packaging to the product. Instead, we package our products in glass or metal. We are constantly
          exploring alternatives to plastic packaging, and we are looking forward to when we can move 100% away from plastic. Every
          time you buy our products you are voting with your dollar. As we grow we will be able to have a lasting positive effect on
          the entire natural product ecosystem and planet. We do what we can today, but you are making what we can do tomorrow possible.<br/><br/>
          Affordable prices - We want everyone to be able to buy our products, so we price as affordably as possible. When we launch
          a new product, we research the prices of similar all-natural / organic products, and then we price on the lower end. <br/><br/>Made
          in Seattle in small batches - All of our manufacturing is in Seattle, WA. We are committed to a small batch production process
          – 16 or less units at a time. Small batches allow us to scrutinize every unit, to ensure that they meet our standards. We
          are committed to hand-craft and attention to detail. <br/><br/>Cruelty free - We test on ourselves first, never on animals. Animal testing
          is just crazy, and implies that the big companies are making products that might be dangerous to people, so they need to
          test on animals first. We’re not mixing up chemical cocktails, so when we make something new we try it ourselves. And then
          on about 50 of our friends. Local, sustainable sourcing - We source everything we can locally, because we believe in investing
          in the communities where we live. For example, we buy all our jars and bottles from Specialty Bottle and our labels from
          Richmark Label, two Seattle companies that have supported us from the beginning. We strive to keep our environmental footprint
          small, and we continually reduce waste. <br/><br/>More than just a living wage - The idea of paying our employees a “living wage” seems
          weird to us, because it implies paying just enough for someone to get by. We want all of our employees to thrive, and so
          we strive to pay higher-than-market-value wages and real benefits. We know that well-paid employees won’t cut corners, will
          stay with us for a long time, and will actively work to better themselves. These benefits are priceless, and well-worth paying
          above market wages.</p>
