          <p>Facebook Inc. recorded rising revenue and profits in the first quarter as advertisers were undeterred by controversies around the site’s mishandling of user data and struggles to police its platform.

          The social-media giant reported a quarterly per-share profit of $1.69, up from $1.04 a year earlier, while revenue rose nearly 50% to $11.97 billion. Net income rose 63% to nearly $5 billion, compared with $3.06 Billion a year ago. </p>

            <h2>Google is giving Gmail a makeover</h2>
            <p class="date">Apr 25th 2018</p>
            <p>The new Gmail is available today for all personal Gmail users and G Suite early adopter program (EAP) customers, but all are intended to boost team productivity, according to David Thacker, VP Product Management for G Suite.
                Gmail is getting deeper G Suite intergations to directly create and edit Google Calendar invites, send notes to Google Keep, and manage to-do items in Tasks. Google is also releasing new Tasks mobile apps for Android and iOS for adding and editing tasks from your smartphone to manage in Calendar and Gmail. The Tasks app is available today in the iOS App Store and Google Play Store.
                Aside from the new-look web app and Tasks mobile apps, Google also announced new security features, including Gmail confidential mode, and expanded AI capabilities like smart replies and notification priority settings.</p>
                 
                
            <p> Confidential mode is the biggest new Gmail security feature. This lets users not only lock a message containing sensitive information, but lets you set an expiration date for when the email will disappear, the same way an ephemeral message would on Snapchat. If a message is locked, it needs to be authenticated either by granting access or using additional two-factor authentication via SMS.
                There's also more granular control in confidential mode over what the recepient can do you with that email, including the ability for senders to enable or revoke privileges like forwarding or downloading attachments. Google redesigned Gmail's security warnings to more prominently label potential phishing traps or other high-risk emails, a welcome addition especially given Gmail's recent scam issues.
                The more subtle aspect of Gmail's redesign is on the intelligence side. Google is building AI into all its products, and there are a handful of new smart Gmail features rolling out as part of the update. One big productivity-focused addition is a Nudging feature, where Gmail will proactively remind you to follow up and respond to messages.
                There's a new high-priority notification setting as well. When enabled, users will only get notifications for impoortant messages to help reduce the clutter and noise in the everyday email experience. Google will also pop up new elements called unsubscribe cards recommending you unsubscribe from senders or mailing lists that frequently end up unopened or deleted.
                Gmail's offline capabilities have been bolstered as well, allowing you to search, write, respond, delete, or archive up to 90 days of messages while offline. Finally, Google is expanding Smart Reply, which had previously only been available in mobile apps, to the Gmail web interface.</p>

              <h2>Behind the scenes with the hackers who unlocked the Nintendo Switch</h2>
              <p class="date">Apr 25th, 2018</p>
              <p> As part of her "day job" as a security contractor and teacher, Temkin says she already maintains a collection of USB hacking tools that helped in reverse-engineering the Tegra's flawed USB controller code. Once that was done, it was relatively simple to spot the "length request" vulnerability that lets an attacker overflow a DMA buffer and insert code into the application stack, she said. "[It's] not particularly difficult to find if you had a bit of USB expertise."

              "Interestingly, if I had been less interested in reverse engineering and more in security auditing, I would almost definitely have been able to find this bug without having gained access to the bootROM," she added. "Some of the standard auditing techniques I teach my students would have easily found the vulnerability."
              
              Along those same lines, Temkin says Nvidia may have hurt its own hardware security by attempting to hide its bootROM code from the public. "I imagine if their bootROMs were open source, this would have been found almost immediately, and even a binary distribution of the bootROM would have made it so researchers could easily identify the vulnerability, leading to a more immediate fix," she said.
              
              Temkin says the same basic USB vulnerability has existed in Tegra chips "for the better part of a decade" and only remained hidden for this long because not many people cared much about previous Tegra-powered devices. "I’ve joked before that the best way to get a chip security audited is to put it in a game console," she said. "If it had been discovered in any of the earlier processors, it could easily have been fixed before Nvidia began implementing the X1."
              
              In response to a request for comment from Ars Technica, an Nvidia spokesperson pointed us to a security notice posted Tuesday, which notes that "this issue cannot be exploited remotely, even if the device is connected to the Internet. Rather, a person must have physical access to an affected processor’s USB connection to bypass the secure boot and run unverified code." Nvidia also notes that subsequent Tegra systems (like the X2) and Nvidia GPUs are not affected by the same issue. </p>

                <h2>Three years out, Final Fantasy VII remake still seems a long way off</h2>
                <p class="date">Apr 25th, 2018</p>
                <p>We're now approaching three full years since Sony first announced it was remaking the beloved Final Fantasy VII for the PlayStation 4. In that time, we've only seen a quick trailer's worth of gameplay footage (itself now over two years old) and a few scattered pieces of concept art for the mysterious project.

                    Now, a new Japanese job posting from publisher Square Enix suggests the developers are still in the early stages of the project, which aims to be something much more ambitious than a simple remake of the 1997 original.
                    
                    As translated by Gematsu, Square Enix's new job posting is looking for a "Battle Planner" that will lead the "creation of a battle system that combines commands and action" (this despite the fact that battle scenes were shown in a 2015 trailer for the project). The publisher is also filling a "Level Planner" position that will devise ideas for level designs and help construct a "workflow for location production."
                    
                    Suffice it to say, these don't sound like positions that would be necessary for a mature, years-old development effort that is nearing the final stages of polish. Instead, they suggest Square Enix is still in the early planning stages for the remake, shaping the basic outlines of the game's structure and concept years after its announcement. That's bad news for anyone hoping for an impending release in the next few months (or years).
                    
                    Last year, Square Enix announced it was shifting to an internal development team rather than leaning on the "support for external partners" for the project, which could help explain the delay in progress. Around the same time, the company posted a recruitment ad that said it was heading into the "development progress phase" and looking for more internal help.
                    
                    "Reproducing the world of Final Fantasy VII in high-definition requires an extraordinary amount of time and resources, so we’ll need all the help we can get to shorten that," Director Tetsuya Nomura said at the time. "In order to further strengthen the development of this title, we must urgently recruit as much staff as possible."
                    
                    The new job posting notes the developers are "aiming at nothing less than a 'new creation' not limited to a simple remake [of Final Fantasy VII]." The team is planning to "preserve the existing concepts users hold while creating a new world view" and has the goal to "create 'a title that surpasses the original,'" according to the posting.

                  <h2>Super Troopers 2 review: Fans get what they paid for in this crowdfunded surprise</h2>
                  <p class="date">Apr 25th, 2018</p>
                  <p>The Internet hype campaign for Super Troopers 2 sneaked in at the tail end of the crowdfunding gold rush in 2015, and that timing might have made all the difference. Crowdfunding fatigue is alive and well, after all, with the practice significantly dropping off since its mid-'10s heyday. Who knows if the Broken Lizard comedy troupe would have raised over $4.6 million if they'd launched the effort even half a year later?

                      What, then, did fans help create by way of an Indiegogo campaign? Exactly what Broken Lizard promised: "the version of Super Troopers 2 you've been waiting for." Consider that a blessing or a curse, depending on your comedy point of view, but there's just no getting around how spiritually faithful this sequel is to the silly-cops original. More important, however, is that this crowdfunded film does not bend to the simplest catchphrase and old-gag doldrums you might expect. Just because Broken Lizard took fans' money doesn't mean the comics were stuck repeating material from the 2001 film.
                      
                      The result is an easy call for best crowdfunded film in recent memory. That's a low bar to clear, of course, and Super Troopers 2 is by no means a perfect film. But its ingeniously orchestrated stupidity—like a Jackson Pollock painting made up of cop pranks and hard-R visual gags—is must-see stuff for anybody who liked the first film.
                      Sequel, eh? </p>
